Kolibry, derived from the German word for hummingbird (Kolibri), represents a new breed of frontend build tooling that significantly improves the frontend development experience. Just like the hummingbird, known for its quick and agile nature, Kolibry embodies swiftness and adaptability. You can pronounce Kolibri as [`/kolibri/`](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kolibryjs/kolibry@main/docs/public/kolibri.mp3), similar to "kol-ee-bree." It consists of two major parts, redefining the way frontend projects are built and delivering remarkable efficiency and speed.

- A dev server that serves your source files over [native ES modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), with [rich built-in features](https://kolibry.zip/guide/features.html) and astonishingly fast [Hot Module Replacement (HMR)](https://kolibry.zip/guide/features.html#hot-module-replacement).

- A [build command](https://kolibry.zip/guide/build.html) that bundles your code with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org), pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.

In addition, Kolibry is highly extensible via its [Plugin API](https://kolibry.zip/guide/api-plugin.html) and [JavaScript API](https://kolibry.zip/guide/api-javascript.html) with full typing support.
